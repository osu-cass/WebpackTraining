# Webpack Training

> What's this Webpack thing you speak of? Why do I need it, and how do I use it?

The purpose of this training is to equip you with the knowledge needed to use Webpack within projects at OSU CASS-SDG. It's broken down into 6 sections, each to help you grasp a different aspect/concept/practice of Webpack:

1. What is Webpack, and why do we need it?
2. Getting started
3. Anatomy of a Webpack config file
4. Configuring for Typescript
5. Code splitting
6. Vendor bundling

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this training, you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed on your system. To verify this, open up a command prompt (or git bash) and running the following commands:

```sh
# Check the NodeJS version
node -v # >=10.x.x

# Check the NPM version
npm -v # >=6.x.x
```

If either one of those has an issue, visit [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install NodeJS in a fashion of your choice.
